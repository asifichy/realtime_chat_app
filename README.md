# Hello!
> My name is Md. Asif Imtiyaj Chowdhury and I'm a web developer intern at Hexen. 

This is a realtime chat application.

N.B: This is a react based chat app with online online statuses, great design and functionality, icons telling you who read the message, image support, sound notifications, the ability to create multiple rooms, and much more.

The development is in progress. 

Chat Engine - uses sockets behind the scene. It's the easiest chat API to get started on. 

I have used chat engine and its backend is hosted on https://chatengine.io/ 


Here the method of adding new members into the team chat is the admin can (only) add new members. (Logout button is future task), and the team members will get realtime message notification (using sound to alert), sending images/files into the team chat. (This is a (beginner) clone version of MS Team). Also we can see who is active using active sign in avatars.
