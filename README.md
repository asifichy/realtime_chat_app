# Hello!
> My name is Md. Asif Imtiyaj Chowdhury and I'm a web developer intern at Hexen. 

This is a realtime chat application.

N.B: This is a react based chat app with online online statuses, great design and functionality, icons telling you who read the message, image support, sound notifications, the ability to create multiple rooms, and much more.

The development is in progress. 

Chat Engine - uses sockets behind the scene. It's the easiest chat API to get started on. 

npx create-react-app ./ it allows to create a new react application right into the directory.

- Now I will create a login system different people login and chat with eachother.

The work is in progress. !!!
